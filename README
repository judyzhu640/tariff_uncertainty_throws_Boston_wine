#Tariff uncertainty throws Boston wine importers into planning confusion
By Ziyue Zhu

This repository documents the reporting and data analysis behind my story  

The project combines interview reporting with port-level import data to show how shifting tariff signals, rather than a single policy change disrupted the timing of wine shipments into Boston in 2025.

## Story context

In early 2025, president Donald Trump repeatedly floated and then adjusted potential tariffs on wine imports from the European Union.  

Boston wine importers and distributors told me that the uncertainty itself made it difficult to plan: suppliers delayed shipments, and importers hesitated to place new orders.

Port of Boston import records show that this policy uncertainty coincided with an unusual break in the typical seasonal pattern of wine imports:
- May 2025 saw a sharp drop compared with both April and recent years.
- June 2025 showed a rebound that reversed the typical seasonal slowdown.

This repo reconstructs that pattern step by step.
